# intro_compiler_course

I taught the course COP3402 Systems Software in Fall 2016. We used C to implement a simple compiler from scratch.
I uploaded the lecture slides to this repo. 

Materials for the programming assignments are in [https://bitbucket.org/schneider128k/2016_fall_cop3402/](https://bitbucket.org/schneider128k/2016_fall_cop3402). 

The solutions for the programming assignments are in
