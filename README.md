# intro_compiler_course

I taught the course COP3402 Systems Software in Fall 2016. We used C to implement a simple compiler from scratch.
I uploaded the lecture slides to this repo. 

Some materials are still in [https://bitbucket.org/schneider128k/2016_fall_cop3402/](https://bitbucket.org/schneider128k/2016_fall_cop3402/).
